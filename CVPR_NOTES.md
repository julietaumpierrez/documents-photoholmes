# PhotoHolmes - CVPR edition

The current source code and documentation is the submission of PhotoHolmes for the CVPR Workshop on Media Forensics. This implies that some adaptations have been made in order to fulfill the double-blind procedure, which we wish to clarify.

1. **Github remote repository:** The code was developed using gitlab and has will have a remote repository in github to recieve contributions when it is published.
2. **PyPI:** It will also be available in PyPI, for users to easily install using `pip install photoholmes` (the current `pip install -e .` is a workaround for the meantime).
3. **Datasets:** Some datasets, the OSN datasets concretely, are not available publicly with the directory structure required. A library user is free to create these from the [ImageForensicsOSN](https://github.com/HighwayWu/ImageForensicsOSN) repository, but the team will provide a download link for those with public license.

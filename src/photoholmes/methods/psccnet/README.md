# CAT-Net: Compression Artifact Tracing Network for Detection and Localization of Image Splicing

This is the implemenattion of the PSCC-Net model presented [[1]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.10596).

The code contained in this library was derived from [the original implementation](https://github.com/proteus1991/PSCC-Net), making only minor changes to fit our project structure.

## Description

PSCC-Net is an end-to-end fully convolutional neural network.
